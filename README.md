The program is like an online fast food ordering app. First, it prompts the user to order a sandwich, first it lets the user choose how many sandwiches they wold like to order and then it gives options for what sandwiches there are along with the price of each, The once the user selects which sandwich they want, the program will display the sandwiches that the user selected and add the price to the total, if the user enters 0 then that means they chose not to order a sandwich. Then the program will prompt the user to order a drink, first it will ask how many drinks they would like and then give size options and prices, if there user enters 0 then the program will display that they did not order a drink, if they do order it will display how many drinks and what size they ordered, the price will then be added to the total. Next, the program will prompt the user to order fries, first it will ask how many fries they want to order then give sizes and the price that corresponds with it, if they user input 0 then the program will display that they did not order fries, if else it will display how many fries they ordered and the price and then add to the total. if the users selects the small size fries, the program will prompt the user if they would like to mega-size their fries, which converts their small order to a large. This is with nested functions. Next, THe program will prompt the user one final time if they would like to order ketchup packets, it will also tell the price of each ketchup packet, the user can choose how many ketchup packets they would like to order by inputting an integer, if they would not like any ketchup packets, they would input 0. Lastly, the program will then display entire order by displaying a list with all the items odered appended to it and the total price too that was continously added upon based on what the user ordered. HOWEVER, the program is not finished yet, the program will ask the user if they would like to remove any items from their order, the program will display the list with all the items they ordered and will tell that the following items are removable, if the user wants to remove something then they write what item they want to remove, after the program will display the users final order and the new total cost, however if the user does not want to remove anything then the program will return the current order and total price again, that is where it ends. This program is for everyone and anyone who would like to get some grub online.
